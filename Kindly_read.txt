Dear Sir,

I know how to make non responsive websites, but I am currently extensively learning various responsive frameworks to make the given webpages, It would be great if I am given some more time to learn and make all the webpages. I hope I am given the chance.

Please turn on notifications for convenience.

Thank you.
